get_top_client_news - Feature Guide

WHAT IT DOES
Returns the top 3 most relevant news items for a specific client, combining:
- Portfolio holdings - news affecting stocks they own
- Watchlist items - news about instruments they're tracking
- Lateral connections - news about competitors, suppliers, and sector peers
- Semantic relevance - news matching their investment style and mandate

WHEN TO USE IT
Use this tool when asked questions like:
- "What should I tell my client today?"
- "What's the top news for [client name]?"
- "Give me talking points for my meeting with [client]"
- "What's relevant for this hedge fund/pension client?"

HOW IT WORKS
The tool scores each news item using four factors:
1. Graph relevance (35%) - Direct holdings score highest, then watchlist, then competitors/suppliers
2. Semantic fit (35%) - How well the news matches the client's investment mandate and style
3. Impact score (20%) - Market significance of the news (Platinum > Gold > Silver)
4. Recency (10%) - Fresher news ranks higher

- Title and document ID
