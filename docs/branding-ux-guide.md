# GOFR Console Branding UX Guide

This guide outlines a step-by-step branding plan to make GOFR Console unmistakably branded across the UI. It prioritizes clarity, consistency, and fast recognition.

## Step 1: Core Brand Presence (AppBar + Favicon)

**Goal:** Ensure branding is visible on every screen and in the browser tab.

- Replace the browser favicon with the GOFR logo.
- Add a logo lockup (icon + wordmark) in the AppBar for both AppShell and ServiceShell.

## Step 2: Persistent Sidebar Branding

**Goal:** Reinforce branding in persistent navigation areas.

- Add a small logo badge at the top of the left Drawer (AppShell + ServiceShell).
- Use a compact size to avoid clutter while keeping recognition high.

## Step 3: Service Breadcrumb Branding

**Goal:** Make service pages feel part of the GOFR Console system.

- Add logo lockup to the ServiceShell AppBar (same styling as the main AppShell).
- Keep breadcrumb text for navigation but anchor it with the logo.

## Step 4: Visual Hierarchy Consistency

**Goal:** Make branded elements feel intentional and consistent.

- Use consistent spacing (8–12px gap between logo and text).
- Keep logo height 28–32px in AppBar and 28–32px in Drawer.

## Step 5: Optional Enhancements (Future)

**Goal:** Further strengthen brand presence without overloading the UI.

- Add a subtle watermark in empty states (low opacity).
- Add a branded loading screen (logo + “Loading GOFR Console”).
- Align typography pairing if a brand font is chosen (Inter body, Sora headings).
